# New Listings on Raydium Dex

This repository hosts a Python-based tool designed to track new listings on various decentralized crypto exchanges, at the beginning there will only be code for Raydium DEX on Solana.

For access to the Solana Mainnet, it is required to enter a Websocket URI from Quicknode for the Solana Raydium Eventlog Websocket. This can easily be found on Quicknode after creating an account. The URI has to be inserted into the 'quicknode_uri' variable in the run function.
